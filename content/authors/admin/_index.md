I am an Assistant Professor at the Department of Government and International Affairs, [Lingnan University](https://www.ln.edu.hk/cht/gia/people/academic-staff/zhu-hongshen) in Hong Kong. Previously, I was a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for the Study of Contemporary China at the [University of Pennsylvania](https://cscc.sas.upenn.edu/people/hongshen_zhu) and East Asia Center at the [University of Virginia](https://eastasiacenter.as.virginia.edu/). My research focuses on authoritarian politics, comparative political economy, and Chinese bureaucracy and governance. I am interested in using high-frequency and geo-located data to analyze political decision-making. My work has been featured in the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/16/world/asia/china-mass-killings-security.html), [Wall Street Journal](https://wsj.com), [Associated Press](https://apnews.com), [Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/finance-and-economics/2023/10/10/how-economists-have-underestimated-chinese-consumption), [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/china-night-riding-army-soup-dumplings-cycling-youth-zhengzhou-kaifeng-rcna179535), and other outlets.

I earned my Ph.D. in Political Science and M.A. in Economics from [Duke University](https://polisci.duke.edu/). Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at the [University of Warwick](https://warwick.ac.uk/).
